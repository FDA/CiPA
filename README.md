# Comprehensive *in vitro* Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA)<br/> *in silico* model
R code used to perform uncertainty quantification for the CiPA *in silico* model and validate the model with the validation data set.

## Authors
Kelly Chang, Zhihua Li, Bradley J. Ridder

## Requirements
This code was developed with R version 3.3 and uses the following packages:
* optparse (version 1.4.4)
* deSolve (version 1.14)
* cmaes (version 1.0-11)
* FME (version 1.3.5)
* rms (4.5-0)
* ggplot2 (version 1.14)

## Uncertainty characterization
[hERG_fitting/](hERG_fitting/) contains code to perform uncertainty characterization for drug binding kinetics of the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) channel gating model ([README.md](hERG_fitting/README.md)).

[Hill_fitting/](Hill_fitting/) contains code to perform uncertainty characterization of dose-response curves for six ionic currents (ICaL, INaL, INa, Ito, IKs, and IK1) ([README.md](Hill_fitting/README.md)).

IC50_mcmc_jobs.sh was designed to do training and validation data separately (by providing different input data files).

## Uncertainty propagation
[AP_simulation/](AP_simulation/) contains code to propagate uncertainty in drug effects to action potential (AP) simulations. Results from [hERG_fitting/](hERG_fitting/) and [Hill_fitting/](Hill_fitting/) are used as model inputs ([README.md](AP_simulation/README.md)).

## Work Specific to Validation Paper
Use the hERG_fitting code to do hERG fitting on all 28 drugs. Hill_fitting contains four different data sets: 
* manual training
* manual validation
* high-throughput training
* high-throughput validation

Adjust the code in Hill_fitting "IC50_mcmc_jobs.sh" to point at the correct files. An example is given in that code file.

Steps:

* In [/Hill_Fitting](/Hill_Fitting), execute (IC50_mcmc_jobs.sh). Make sure there is a [logfiles/](logfiles/) folder in that folder. A [results/](results/) and [figs/](figs/) folder will appears with results and figures.
* In [/AP_simulation](/AP_simulation), execute (AP_uncertainty_jobs.sh). Adjust AP_uncertainty_jobs.sh to target the results folder you made in the first step.
* In the [/AP_simulation](/AP_simulation) folder, use "Rscript combine_results.R -n 2000" to combine results and produce metrics.rds.
