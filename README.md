# Comprehensive *in vitro* Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA)<br/> *in silico* model
R code used to perform uncertainty quantification for the CiPA *in silico* model

## Authors
Kelly Chang, Zhihua Li

## Requirements
This code was developed with R version 3.3 and uses the following packages:
* optparse (version 1.4.4)
* deSolve (version 1.14)
* cmaes (version 1.0-11)
* FME (version 1.3.5)
* rms (4.5-0)
* ggplot2 (version 1.14)

## Uncertainty characterization
[hERG_fitting/](hERG_fitting/) contains code to perform uncertainty characterization for drug binding kinetics of the human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene (hERG) channel gating model ([README.md](hERG_fitting/README.md)).

[Hill_fitting/](Hill_fitting/) contains code to perform uncertainty characterization of dose-response curves for six ionic currents (ICaL, INaL, INa, Ito, IKs, and IK1) ([README.md](Hill_fitting/README.md)).

## Uncertainty propagation
[AP_simulation/](AP_simulation/) contains code to propagate uncertainty in drug effects to action potential (AP) simulations. Results from [hERG_fitting/](hERG_fitting/) and [Hill_fitting/](Hill_fitting/) are used as model inputs ([README.md](AP_simulation/README.md)).
