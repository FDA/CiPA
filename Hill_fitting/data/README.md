# Patch clamp data
[mergedpatchclampdata-20160514.csv](mergedpatchclampdata-20160514.csv) contains patch clamp data from Crumb *et al.* 2016. Note that some of the data have been updated since publication of this article.

The R script [process_patchclamp_data.R](process_patchclamp_data.R) processes the Crumb *et al.* 2016 data into correct format for simulations. This script also replaces the Crumb *et al.* 2016 hERG data with data from White Oak ([WO_hERG_block.csv](WO_hERG_block.csv)), extracted from [here](../../hERG_fitting/data/).
