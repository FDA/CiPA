# Uncertainty characterization of dose-response curves
This code performs uncertainty characterization of dose-response curves (the Hill equation) for ionic current block using a Bayesian inference approach.

## Proviso
This MCMC fitting code was intended to be "frozen", but in practice this was not possible due to the noisiness of high-throughput data. The MCMC fitting code was altered to be made more robust to experimental noise.

## Data format
Patch clamp data should be stored in comma-separated value (CSV) format. Files should be stored in comma-separated value (CSV) format with the following headers:

* **drug**: drug name
* **conc**: drug concentration in nM
* **channel**: name of ionic current tested
* **block**: amount of block (%)

To generate data for the 12 CiPA training drugs, run:

```
cd data
Rscript --vanilla process_patchclamp_data.R
```

This will create the file [data/drug_block.csv](data/drug_block.csv), containing experimental results for the 12 CiPA training drugs as well as some additional compounds (see [README.md](data/README.md) for details).

## Running the code
This code uses the FME package (version 1.3.5).

To fit bepridil:

```
Rscript --vanilla IC50_mcmc.R -d bepridil
```

The code attempts to fit an IC50 value and Hill coefficient for each drug-channel pair in the data and then obtains a joint sampling distribution of the parameters using Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC). For data that cannot be fitted, these values are omitted from the output.

New data can be fit by specifying the data file path (and the drug name):

```
Rscript --vanilla IC50_mcmc.R -d drug1 -f my_data_file.csv
```

By default, 2000 samples are saved from the MCMC run. A different number of samples can be saved:

```
Rscript --vanilla IC50_mcmc.R -d drug1 -f my_data_file.csv -n 3000
```

For additional help:

```
Rscript --vanilla IC50_mcmc.R -h
```
